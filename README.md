# Installation
This is only intended to be run on Linux Ubuntu distro 18.04. You may need root user access for some commands.

Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) then follow the rocker repo instructions to [install rocker](https://github.com/osrf/rocker)

For ease of installation, make sure to pull the following images when convenient as they will take while to download.

``` shell
# (~2.5 GB)
$ docker pull osrf/ros:eloquent-desktop
# (~8 GB)
$ docker pull moveit/moveit2:eloquent-source 
```

# Running 
In terminal, navigate to this repos directory. 

Run the following to start the ros nodes and rviz to display

``` shell
# Start nodes running ROS
$ docker-compose up

# Activate your python venv containing rocker
$ . ~/rocker_venv/bin/activate   

# Start rviz 
$ rocker --nvidia --x11 --network=host osrf/ros:eloquent-desktop rviz
```

## Integrated Graphics (laptop/no gpu)
If you do not have a Nvidia GPU, then please run this command to use intel integrated graphics.
``` shell
$ rocker --devices /dev/dri/card0 --x11 --network=host osrf/ros:eloquent-desktop rviz
```

## Running Gazebo
``` shell
$ rocker --nvidia --x11 osrf/ros:melodic-desktop-full gazebo
```

# ROS2 Notes
More info can be found in the [Migration guild from ROS 1](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Contributing/Migration-Guide/).
## Build Tools

Catkin is a ROS1 package. ROS 2 instead used colcon (e.g. colcon build). To use it:

We source an environment setup file (in this case the one generated by following the ROS 2 installation tutorial, which builds in ~/ros2_ws, then we build our package using colcon build:
``` shell
. ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
cd ~/ros2_talker
colcon build 
```

### Running a ROS 2 node
talker is an installed executable in bin, so after sourceing the setup file above, we can invoke it by name directly
``` shell
. ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
talker
```




# Recomendations
If you're building your own image, base it on the following image rather than ros:eloquent:
``` yaml
FROM osrf/ros:eloquent-desktop
```
